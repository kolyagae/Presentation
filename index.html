                    <h4>How do Scrum teams work?</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">A Scrum team is typically made up of “ten or fewer people,” as outlined by the Scrum Guide. However, the team’s size depends mainly on the project in view. The objective of the Scrum framework is to deliver value to the end-user by following a structure for iterative planning and fast delivery.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 25px;">For Scrum to be effective, there has to be strong communication, accountability, and collaboration between team members.</p>

                                Often viewed as the facilitator, the Scrum master is a servant-leadership position within the Scrum team. The Scrum master’s responsibilities include:
